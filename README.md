# EEG-ANLYTICAL-MODEL-FOR-ESTIMATE-CONFSUION-AND-CONCENTRATE-LEVEL
The EEG (Electroencephalogram) Analytical Model is designed to analyze brainwave data to estimate an individual's confusion and concentration levels. This model leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques to interpret EEG signals and provide real-time assessments of cognitive states.
