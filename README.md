# EEG-ANLYTICAL-MODEL-FOR-ESTIMATE-CONFSUION-AND-CONCENTRATE-LEVEL
The EEG (Electroencephalogram) Analytical Model is designed to analyze brainwave data to estimate an individual's confusion and concentration levels. This model leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques to interpret EEG signals and provide real-time assessments of cognitive states.

# Purpose
# The primary objectives of this project are to:
Monitor and Enhance Learning: Provide real-time assessments of students' attention and confusion levels during lessons.
Identify Learning Gaps: Detect moments when students are confused or losing concentration, allowing for timely interventions.
Improve Teaching Strategies: Offer data-driven insights to help educators tailor their teaching methods to student needs.
